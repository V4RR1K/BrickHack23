## Description
Katabasis is a thrilling rhythm game that takes players on a journey through 
the underworld with a dancing protagonist as their guide. The game's main 
character is a skilled dancer who finds himself on a perilous mission 
through the dark and twisted realm of Hell. However, with his rhythmic 
ring of harmony, he is able to protect himself from the dangers that lurk in the shadows.

As players journey alongside the dancing hero, they must use their musical 
skills to keep the rhythmic ring of harmony going and fend off any threats 
that come their way. The game's innovative rhythm mechanics make it a 
unique and exciting experience, requiring players to move to the beat 
of the music while also dodging obstacles and fighting off enemies.

highlight, with a diverse range of genres that perfectly match the game's themes 
and atmosphere.
