# Katabasis: Rhythm Hellscape

## Game Description
Katabasis is a thrilling rhythm game that takes players on a journey through 
the underworld with a dancing protagonist as their guide. The game's main 
character is a skilled dancer who finds himself on a perilous mission 
through the dark and twisted realm of Hell. However, with his rhythmic 
ring of harmony, he is able to protect himself from the dangers that lurk in the shadows.

As players journey alongside the dancing hero, they must use their musical 
skills to keep the rhythmic ring of harmony going and fend off any threats 
that come their way. The game's innovative rhythm mechanics make it a 
unique and exciting experience, requiring players to move to the beat 
of the music while also dodging obstacles and fighting off enemies.

The game's world is designed to be visually stunning, with dark, foreboding environments 
and eerie creatures lurking around every corner. The music in Katabasis is also a major 
highlight, with a diverse range of genres that perfectly match the game's themes 
and atmosphere.

## Project Goal
This application was coded in a 24 hour period from February 25th, 12:00pm to February 26th,
12:00pm for BrickHack 9 at RIT. The initial goal was to create a rhythm game similar to 
guitar hero with a different control schematic with a 64bit art style. This app is made
to demonstrate the groups developing, artistic, and musical skills and combine our love
for video games.
